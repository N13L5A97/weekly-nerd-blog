## CSS Containers

CSS containers is all about measuring "the box". We have media queries which can measure the viewport and after a long time of hearing it wasn't possible to create container queries because of content loops it is finally possible. By default the box size on content. With container queries we can tell the content what to do at a specific container size.

```css
@container style(--color: blue){
    background: blue;
}
```

## Reflection

After a long talk from Bramus we had the privilege to hear about Miriam's container queries. To be honest I did not have the concentration left to listen to every detail, but I already knew some minor things about this subject. I noticed the talk was also made for people that already knew a lot about the subject so after a while I wasn't able to follow most of it because this was just out of my league. I did find it fascinating what you can do with these types of if statements because that is basically what it is. Besides the talk I love seeing queer/trans people on stage it makes me proud.

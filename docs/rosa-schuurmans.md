# Rosa Schuurmans

Rosa is a digital creative who did - and still does - a LOT of things. She worked for Elastique for 5 years, studied (de)fine art, gives workshops, builds websites, studies Master of Arts in Fine Art and Design and is a freelance digital maker for her own company Vitrinekast.

## Circuit Bending

One of her hobbies is circuit bending. Circuit bending is creative manipulation of circuits in electronic devices to create new music or visual instruments. This originally came from the 70's and was the start of electronic art or unstable media. The fun thing about circuit bending is that you have an "immediate canvas". There is basically no way of knowing what will happen until it's done.

### The Rules

The rules for circuit bending are easy.

- Since it could be a bit dangerous playing with electronics they tell you to only use battery based electronics.
- Use you eyes, hands, nose and your brain.
- Find the short circuit
- Write down where you found the short circuit
- Make some sort of interaction

You can find a short circuit by playing a wet finger on 2 connectors and look what happens. But WATCH OUT you can get shocked. This is why they only use battery based electronics.

### Circuit Bending the Web

You could compare circuit bending with the inspector mode in your browser. You sometimes have all the elements in front of you and you have to play with them a bit to get what you want.

You can also circuit bend websites. Downloading software on older devises is a way of circuit bending. Do things that don't really fit the status quo. In this way you are perceiving more of your surroundings and you will learn a lot more.

## Programs

Some of the programs Rosa mentioned:

- sample brain
- Pure Data (to make music)
- GameMaker Studio (to make games)

## Reflection

To be honest at first I was a bit confused about the purpose of her talk. Although I thought circuit bending was a really cool hobby of hers I didn't quite get the connection to web design and development. But later in her talk I started to understand how important creativity can be and how you can actually combine your hobbies in some ways. I got really inspired by her and made me realize I am able to do a lot more things in life then I initially thought.

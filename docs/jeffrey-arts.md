# Week 3 

## Who is Jeffrey Arts?

Jeffrey has a background in front-end development and a bachelor in product design. He is an artist, designer and front-end developer and likes to combine art and tech with each other.

## Web Development Ecosystem

When setting up a website it is nice to have some sort of ecosystem. Try to use core technologies as much as possible and create tools to support your personal workflow. Jeffrey created his own command - "yarn jeff-front-end" - to set up his own project template. This is his boilerplate where he can easily start working with. He told us to create an ecosystem for yourself where every element strengthens each other.

## Toolbox Workflow

It often happens that you're programming and you f*ck something up. In this case you want to go back to a previous version but you're not sure which one. Try to cut your project in smaller pieces. When a function is working put a copy of this in a toolbox so you can use it later. This toolbox makes you ecosystem even better.

## Try, Fail, New Truth, Succeed, Reflect

Jeffrey showed us some experiments with a div element and told us the one he liked the most was the one that actually glitched because of browser support. Keep failing and use this as a source of inspiration.

"Keep trying and reflecting. Try to gain experience from that and let yourself be inspired by this to keep building".

## Reflection

Jeffrey showed us a lot of his art projects that were really cool. The talk was a bit chaotic so it was hard to follow. There was not really a common thread in his story but after some reflecting I did find this talk really nice. Mostly the part where he found a way to combine his passion for art with his passion for front-end development. I would love to be able to combine all my hobbies into one major project. But also the way he made a toolbox for himself. I would love to do this once I have a little more experience.

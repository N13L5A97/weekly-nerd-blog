## Who am I?

I'm a 26 year old student living in Amsterdam. I am currently in my third year of Communication and Multi-media Design, following the minor web design and development at Hogeschool van Amsterdam (HvA).

## What I Want To Learn

At minor web I would love to improve my HTML, CSS and Javascript techniques, make my website more accessible and gain more confidence in my ability to make websites.

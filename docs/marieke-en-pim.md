# Marieke en Pim

## Who are Marieke & Pim

Marieke is an ex student of Communication and Multimedia Design of the HvA. She specialized herself in accessibility with her graduation project for Active Collective and works now at Digitaal Toegankelijk with Pim.

Digitaal Toegankelijk started as a web development bureau but have now separated the digitally accessible part of the company. Together they try to make the web a little more inclusive.

## Inclusivity

When thinking about inclusivity it's good to ask yourself 2 questions:

1. Who likes to be excluded?
2. Who likes to exclude others?

There are a lot of people excluded in a lot of websites. This don't have to be people with an chronic disability but can also be a temporary one. Think about breaking your arm, an infected eye or even the sun can be a temporary disability. If you keep all these disabilities in mind you are already in the right way of designing more inclusive.

## Digital Accessibility (WCAG)

The WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) are guidelines for accessible web content and are used to test websites if they are accessible enough based on a set of criteria.

Digitaal Toegankelijk makes use of the big 4:

- Perceivable
Can the content be perceived by everybody?
Think about screen sizes, zooming in or out, alt text, color and contrast.

- Operable
Is the content operable for everybody?
Think about forms being used with only a keyboard, search functions and links.

- Understandable
Kan everyone understand your website?
Think about language, difficult words or dyslexia.

- Robust
Is the technology behind my digital product built semantically?
Think about the structure, headings and correct elements.

### Examples

- Audio Control (Perceivable)

It's very important that the user is able to pause sounds on your website. It can be very disturbing for screen reader users. Make sure that if the sound is longer then 3 seconds it can be paused.

- No Keyboard Trap (Operable)

When a user navigates with their keyboard it's not supposed to happen that the used is not able to exit an element or other part of the webpage. This is called a keyboard trap. Make sure the user is able to navigate with keyboard and test if you get stuck.

- Pause, Stop, Hide (Understandable)

All moving, flashing, scrolling or elements that start automatically, take longer then 5 seconds or is shown parallel to other content has to be able to be paused, stopt of hidden.

- Thee Flashes or Below Threshold (Robust)

On webpages NO element can be flashing 3 times in one second. This can be very dangerous for people with epilepsy.

## Most Important Tips

- Listen to your website with a screen reader.
- Navigate your website with keyboard only
- Test with your target audience

## Reflection

I think accessibility is very important and love to hear about it when people are as passionate about it a I am. I think the work Pim and Marieke are doing is amazing, but I don't think I learned a lot of new things this lecture. The only new thing for me was about how many times something can flash in a second for epileptic people. But although most information wasn't new for me I think it's very valuable to spread the word and make people realize how important inclisivity and accessability is.

# Waag

## What is Waag?

"Waag works in a team of designers, artists and scientists, who apply public research methods to technology and society. In doing so, Waag enables as many people as possible to help design an open, fair and inclusive future."

## The Workshop

Waag came to the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam to do a workshop about social values. We did an exercise where we had to place ourselves in one of the four boxes on the floor that was linked to one of the answers we could give to a number of questions. The questions were about whether you use Apple, Android or something else, whether you have ever switched phone brands/systems and questions about privacy, data and personal values.

After this exercise we were given a form in groups on which we had to write down what our values ​​are when having a phone and which have been realized and which have not. Then we started building our own kind of ideal phone based on values ​​with abstract, hexagonal images. This resulted in designs in which safety was a top priority for many people.

## Reflection

The assignments were very confusing for many people. It was not very clear what exactly they were asking of us. They used terms that did not really appeal to our class and for several of us it felt a bit like we were guinea pigs for their workshop rather than that we were really there to learn something.

## Who is Jeremy Keith


## Declarative Design

Musical composition.
one approach is mozart, classical music.
- which notes 
- how long to play them 
- how to play them 

Very structured


... Davis
Jazz approach
- one key 
- improvizing
- more fluently

Feel similair to programming.

You can devide them into 2 different approaches

- imperative programming
Tell the computer exactly what to do.

- declarative programming
You don't tell the computer exactly what to do
Ypu tell the outcome and let the computer

SQL (structured ... Language)

These things may do the same.

How does this apply to the www:

- HTML
Domain specific language. Its a declarative programming language

- CSS
This is another declarative programming language
(you give a suggestions)

- JS
Imperative language
You can do more.

The declarative languages ignore when you make a mistake.
Easy forgiving, easier to learn.

The imperative language does not ignore mistakes
More universal

Whats a big difference:
It's control!

imperative mindset:
"make button with javascript"
more control

declarative mindset:
make button with html

Why whould a developer make a button with js: "more control"

"Javascript should only do what only Javascript can do" (client side javascript!)

css:
- use pixels is more imperative
- use rem is more declarative

- padding-left: more imperative
- padding-inline-start: more declarative

Examples declarative design:

utopia.fyi:
explaines about type scales

youtube.com/layoutland:
intrinsic layout

every-layout.dev:
give boundries but let the computer figure it out.

buildexcellentwebsit.es
"be the browsers mentor, not it's micromanager"

Is declerative then imperative?
answer: it depends -> bullshit
say on what?

- culture of the envoirenment:
management(strict or not)

- Thinking:
analitical: when you break something down in parts and look at them individually (zoom in)
systems: You take a step back and look at the whole (zoom out)

- Design systems: (system thinking)
How do the components get made
Not just the output.
approach is mostly imperative (analitic thinking)
It should be (most of the time) declarative

imperative design system:
- exact components, color, etc.

declarative design systems:
- guidelines
- borders should be 10% lighter than the background color.

- The team
the team can have different superpowers

- The medium
Print -> imperative
native apps -> imperative
os-spesifics -> imperative

www -> declerative
everything keeps changing
"the more you tighten your grip, the more the www slips through your fingers"

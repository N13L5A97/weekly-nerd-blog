## About You

Some of us want to be creative developer, ethical hacker of philosopher. Robert says that CMD is the ideal start to become everything that has to do with humans. You can work at a design agency, start up, web shop, a corporate business of as freelancer. You can write code all day, talk with clients, do research or manage "stuff" or do something totally different. But the most important thing is you should do something you like.

## The Money

Robert told us that there are a lot of things that have influence on our working environment, salary and benefits. It's our responsibility to stay up to date in order to respond to all those changes. But is salary everything you get? You can also have less money but a lot of benefits. What is worth more?

### What is a good salary?

When you're talking about salary you actually always talk about the salary without tax deduction for 40 hours per week. How much do you have left after the tax is deducted? Robert believes we should discuss with each other about our salary, be open, use the internet and calculate your monthly costs to find the salary that suits you.

"Normalize talking about what you should earn."

### What about benefits

Sometimes a job doesn't pay that much but they can lure you in with amazing benefits. With benefits you can think of travel reimbursement, team outings, lunch, vacation days, pension building a company car, profit sharing, stock options or a bonus.

The question is what is worth more? Money or the benefits? Robert says it is the balance between those two.

### The Vibe

Alongside the money and the benefits you can ask yourself, if you just enjoy working there is the money that important? And if you get paid a LOT but you don't like your work, is it still worth it?

Next to the money and benefits you can also have immaterial recognition. This can include leaving early on fridays, amazing colleagues and mentoring, nice outings or that it may be close to your home.

"benefits are not a substitute to a fair and honest salary combined with realistic expectations of a junior"

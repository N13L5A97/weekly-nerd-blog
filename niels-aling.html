			<h3>Who am I?</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a 26 year old student living in Amsterdam. I am currently in
				my third year of Communication and Multi-media Design, following
				the minor web design and development at Hogeschool van Amsterdam
				(HvA).
			</p>
			<h3>What I Want To Learn</h3>
			<p>
				At minor web I would love to improve my HTML, CSS and Javascript
				techniques, make my website more accessible and gain more
				confidence in my ability to make websites.
			</p>
			<h3>Web App from Scratch</h3>
			<p>
				The first 2 weeks were divided into 2 projects. The first
				project was an individual website about yourself. The
				requirements were to use vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript, make
				it responsive, have at least one micro interaction and make use
				of at least one API. The second project was a group project
				where we had to fetch everyone's data from our individual page
				and com eup with a creative way to show each other's data.

				For my website I used the Spotify API to fetch my public
				playlists and display them on my website. I put my data in a
				json file and fetched this from my Github repository. For the
				micro interactions I made some hover effect on the buttons.

				For our group project I came up with the idea to recreate an old

				it. I designed the buttons and windows and made the layout for
				the website. I also created the functions to open close and
				maximize the windows.

			<h3>Browser Technologies and CSS to the Rescue</h3>
			<p>
				Browser Technologies was a subject about creating robust html,
				building a strong foundation for your website in cases things
				might go different then you expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				CSS to the Rescue was all about... CSS of course. We were not
				allowed to use any Javascript, ID's and classes.

				The project was about a form for the Dutch Embassy. This form
				had to work on most devices, browsers, internet speeds and with
				or without Javascript and CSS. We had to think about solutions
				for when one of these technologies was not available. I learned
				a lot about progressive enhancement and how to make a website
				more accessible.

				My CSS to the Rescue project was about creating a control panel
				from an airplane. It was based on a cockpit but I wanted to make
				it pocket sized. I learned a lot from the :has and :not
				selectors and the usage of style queries. I had a lot of fun
				with this project and was able to use a lot of the things I
				learned here in the Browser Technbologies project.

				This hackathon was a 4 day event where we had to create a cool
				website for the CSS Days congress. This was their 10th edition
				and they wanted us to do something with the data of the previous
				editions. This included the speakers, the mc's, the location of
				the events, the dates, the ticket prices and much more. We ended
				up creating a flip clock that showed each year and displayed the
				mc's, ticket information and speaker of that year. It was a
				really fun week and I learned a lot about the intersection
				observer, the fetch API and got a lot better at CSS.

			<h3>API and Human Centered Design</h3>
			<p>
				API was a subject where we had to learn how to fetch data. We
				had to set-up a server with node and use a templating engine to
				render the data on the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Human Centered Design was a project for people with a
				disability. We had to interview and test with the target
				audience and make a product that was accessible for them.

				For the API project I choose to work with the Movie Database.
				Since I'm a Spider-Man fan I thought it would be fun to use that
				in my project. I really got the hang of fetching data and
				working ith node.js and express. I also learned a bit about
				GSAP.

				For this project my "target audience" was Marie. Marie is Deaf
				and told us a lot about her experience with movies. She missed
				the depth of the closed caption. She missed the tone, volume and
				way people speak. Also the music was not really described the
				way she wanted. So for her I tried to create a more lively
				closed caption with other small effect to improve her experience
				while watching movies.

			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				I learned a lot in the last couple of weeks. I can really say I
				achieved my first learning goal. I got a lot better and
				confident at html, css and Javascript. I tried new things and
				found out I really need to ask for help when I can't figure it
				out by myself. I also learned I play it safe now and then and
				that I am allowed to take more risks. Overall I really enjoyed
				the people I worked with and am proud of what I achieved in the
				last couple of weeks.
			</p>
			<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
			<p>
				To attend the "Meesterproef" we need 3 personal learning goals.
				In the last couple of weeks I learned a lot about myself. A lot
				of qualities but also some things I would like to improve.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first thing is that I need to ask for help more often. I
				tend to One of try to solve everything by myself and sometimes I
				get stuck or take while to finish something. I think I need to
				find more balance in this. I want to do this by simply give
				myself a specific time to try something out and after that I ask
				for help.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another thing I would like to improve is trying to dare to take
				more risks. I tend to try it the safe way and build a solid
				structure, but I sometimes forget to be creative and try new
				things, weird things and make mistakes. I want to do this by
				giving myself more space for idea generation and create time to
				explore these ideas. Also present these ideas and learn from my
				mistakes.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think accessability is very important. I always want to make
				sure everyone is able to use my website. I think of how I can
				make my website accessible but most of the time I forget or am
				not sure how to make it accessible enough. I would like to focus
				a bit more on this subject to make it more so that it becomes
				more natural to do. I want to start doing this by learning more
				about ARIA labels and make sure I test on the "basic" accessible
				tools like contrast, tab and alt text.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last but not least. I am still scared to present work. I am
				insecure and I don't like to speak in public. I do it when I
				have to but I would like to be more confident in this because I
				know this could be a very useful skill to have. The thing with
				presenting is I have to just do it over and over again.

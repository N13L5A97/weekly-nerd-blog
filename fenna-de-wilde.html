        <h3>Who is Fenna?</h3>
        <p>
            Jenna is a creative developer at Bakken & Bæck. 
            She is always looking for creative ways to improve web accessibility and loves animating elements to improve user experience. 
            She thrives to improve the accessibility of websites and want people to have a better understanding on how to do so.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            At minor web we learn a lot about accessibility but in the real world not many companies tend to care that much about it. 
            Fenna wants this to change and has a couple of ways on how to improve the accessibility of your website.
        </p>

        <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
        <p>
            One of the first things to make your website more accessible os to write semantic HTML. 
            This means that you use logical elements for the things you create.
        </p>

        <h3>Focus state</h3>
        <p>
            Not all users navigate on websites with a mouse or touch input. 
            Some people use their keyboard. 
            For those users it’s essential to see where their focus is. 
            You can do this by using the pseudo class :focus-visible. 
            This is only visible when using a keyboard for navigating through a website.
        </p>

        <h3>Alt text</h3>
        <p>
            Alt text is essential for users that are visually impaired or even blind. 
            You can add this attribute to your images to describe an image so a screen reader 
            can read this and explain what an image is about.
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;img src=“dog” alt=“a brow dog sitting next to a tree”&gt;
        </code>

        <h3>Line lengths</h3>
        <p>
            The best lengths for text are between 50 to 75 characters including spaces. 
            In css you can use the ch unit for this. 
            Ch stands for character and measures the width of a “0”. So 50ch is 50 zero’s in length.
        </p>

        <h3>Font size</h3>
        <p>
            Readability is very important when designing and developing websites. 
            To make this accessible you should use a minimal font-size of 16px. 
            This is equal to 1em.
        </p>

        <h3>Color Contrast</h3>
        <p>
            There are a lot of visual impairments. 
            Color blindness itself comes in multiple conditions. 
            But also a lot of people have a hard time reading text with low contrast or seeing their screen in bright sunlight. 
            For this it’s important to have a good contrast between your text and the background. 
            WAI(link) has a formula for this. 
            You can use Lighthouse(link) to check multiple accessibility standards of your website and there is also a contrast checker in the google chrome inspector.
        </p>

        <h3>ARIA attributes and roles</h3>
        <p>
            ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. 
            It is a bit similar to alt-text. 
            It can give more information about specific elements. 
            This can be essential for screen readers and makes your website a lot more accessible for visually impaired users.
            You have a lot of different ways to use aria. 
            You can use aria-label to give more information about an element.
        </p>
        <code>          
            &lt;a&gt; src=“/” aria-label=“to home page”&gt; &lt;img src=/logo.png&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            You can also use it to describe the state of an element e.g. a play/pause button. 
            In this case you use javascript to update the attribute when the state changes.
            When dynamically changing states and roles of ARIA attributes you should tell the how it should handle these changes. You can use aria-live for this.
        </p>
        <p>
            aria-live: off (screen reader won’t be updated) <br>
            aria-live: polite (when the   is busy, wait until it’s done and then update the element) <br>
            aria-live: assertive (stop the screen reader and update immediately)
        </p>
        <p>
            This attribute goes ofter together with are-atomic. 
            When setting this to false the   will only introduce the changed nodes. 
            When putting this to true the   will introduce the whole area again.
        </p>

        <h3>Focus Guards</h3>
        <p>
            When opening a modal you want the user to be able to only tab trough elements inside it. 
            When using g a dialog this will be done automatically.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I was really inspired by Fenna’s talk about accessibility. 
            Personally I think it’s very important to make a website as accessible as possible and it really motivates me when others think the same way as I do. 
            The information Fenna provided really helped me improve my way of making my own websites more accessible. 
            I was already familiar with the font-size, alt-text and color contrasts but the ARIA attributes was new for me so I really want to learn more about how to use this the right way.

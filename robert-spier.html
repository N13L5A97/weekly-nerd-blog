			<h3>Who is Robert Spier</h3>
			<p>
				Robert works as creative technologist for the digital factory
				team at Deloitte NL. He studied Media Design, Cumminication and
				Multimedia Design (CMD) and Information Systems, worked as web
				developer at Booreiland, creative producer in the nightlife for
				10+ years and as lecturer at the university of Applied Sciences
				in Amsterdam.
			</p>
			<h3>Creative Technologist (Digital Superhero)</h3>
			<p>
				As Creative Technologist Robert researches emerging
				technologies. He makes creative front-end solutions, does
				qualitative research, manages stakeholders and automates
				basically everything. He has a lot of meetings and he uses the
				time in between to do his own research. At Deloitte he build the
				interface of their "chat gpt". He also deep faked the creator of
				Deloitte.
			</p>
			<h3>About You</h3>
			<p>
				Some of us want to be creative developer, ethical hacker of
				philosopher. Robert says that CMD is the ideal start to become
				everything that has to do with humans. You can work at a design
				agency, start up, web shop, a corporate business of as
				freelancer. You can write code all day, talk with clients, do
				research or manage "stuff" or do something totally different.
				But the most important thing is you should do something you
				like.
			</p>
			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>
				What should you do after CMD? Work at your internship?, go for a
				job hunt, find yourself somewhere, do another study, start a
				traineeship or maybe you'll see after you're done. Robert asked
				a couple alumni what they did after finishing at CMD and this
				where 4 stereotypical answers with what they use for tech stack
				and what they earn:
			</p>

				<li>
					<p>
						Full Service agency (smart TV apps): <br />
						SvelteKit+Vite <br />
						2600.-
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The Money</h3>
			<p>
				Robert told us that there are a lot of things that have
				influence on our working environment, salary and benefits. It's
				our responsibility to stay up to date in order to respond to all
				those changes. But is salary everything you get? You can also
				have less money but a lot of benefits. What is worth more?
			</p>
			<h4>What is a good salary?</h4>
			<p>
				When you're talking about salary you actually always talk about
				the salary without tax deduction for 40 hours per week. How much
				do you have left after the tax is deducted? Robert believes we
				should discuss with each other about our salary, be open, use
				the internet and calculate your monthly costs to find the salary
				that suits you.
			</p>
			<p>"Normalize talking about what you should earn."</p>

			<h4>What about benefits?</h4>
			<p>
				Sometimes a job doesn't pay that much but they can lure you in
				with amazing benefits. With benefits you can think of travel
				reimbursement, team outings, lunch, vacation days, pension
				building a company car, profit sharing, stock options or a
				bonus.
			</p>
			<p>
				The question is what is worth more? Money or the benefits?
				Robert says it is the balance between those two.
			</p>
			<h4>The Vibe</h4>
			<p>
				Alongside the money and the benefits you can ask yourself, if
				you just enjoy working there is the money that important? And if
				you get paid a LOT but you don't like your work, is it still
				worth it?
			</p>
			<p>
				Next to the money and benefits you can also have immaterial
				recognition. This can include leaving early on fridays, amazing
				colleagues and mentoring, nice outings or that it may be close
				to your home.
			</p>
			<p>
				"benefits are not a substitute to a fair and honest salary
				combined with realistic expectations of a junior"
			</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Discuss your benefits with classmates
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						
						Do your own research
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						It's okay to say no to a company

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						"It's your job, you will go there every day. Have fun and
						feel recognized. That's the most important part"
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Do something you like
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				I have known Robert for a while now and I also already have seen this talk of him before. 
				Robert has inspired me personally when he was my mentor. He actually made me realize that I was good in what I do and that I should believe more in myself.
				It's because of him that I once told a teacher I did not agree with him and that I should be graded higher. And I actually got a higher grade.
